# MakerStop

**MakerStop** is an automatic length stop system designed for Makers, metal fabricators, carpenters, and weekend warriors who demand precision without paying commercial-level prices.

Born out of necessity, MakerStop was developed in a small home garage where space, efficiency, and accuracy are the difference between thriving and burnout. As a full-time metal fabricator, I built this tool to meet the real-world demands of daily cutting tasks.

My goal is to make automation accessible—without the bloated cost or complexity. MakerStop is modular, lightweight, and affordable, and it challenges some of the typical assumptions in DIY automation and CNC hardware. If you're curious about how and why certain choices were made, check out the **Design Decisions** section below.
